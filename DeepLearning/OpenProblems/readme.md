# Overview 

The Great Open Problems in Deep Learning 
- **Better Generalization** 
  - Description: How to make ANN generalize well from small amount of data [1]
- **Interpretability**
  - Understand the way ANN solves a problem looking at internal state 
    - Analogous to a sort of "Functional MRI"
