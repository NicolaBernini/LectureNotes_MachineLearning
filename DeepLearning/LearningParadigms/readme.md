# Learning Paradigms Overview 

There 3 main Learning Paradigms 
- Supervised Learning 
- Unsupervised Learning 
- Semi-Supervised Learning 


## Supervised Learning 

- Considering two Variables `X` and `Y` the Conditional PDF `P(Y|X)` is learned 
- A "Training Supervised" exists and it provides Labeled Training Data
- The totality of the data is labeled 
- The Learning Machine learns to imitate the Expert Supervisor without any explicit receipe 
- Also called Discriminative Learning 


## Unsupervised Learning 

- Considering two Variables `X` and `Y` the Joint PDF `P(X,Y)` is learned 
- No "Training Supervised" is supposed to exist 
- As a consequence no labeled data exist 
- The Learning Machine exploits the inherent Data Structure 
- Also called Generative Learning 
  - This name because Synthetic Labeled Datasets `P(Y|X)` can be generated by performing marginalization of the Joint PDF to obtain a Conditional PDF
