# Overview 

The Deep CNN Architecture is made of 2 elements 
- Actual CNN 
  - Typically made of alternate convolutional and pooling layers 
- FFNN 
  - Typically a Multilayer Perceptron

# Properties 

## Locality 

Each specific Convolutional Kernel acts only on a subset of the Information represented in the previous layer 
- The information stored in the previous layer could be the Raw Image or one layer of the "HyperImage" generated by previous Convolutional Layers 


Here it is represented an example of non-overlapping application of the same Convolutional Kernel `A` on the `X` Input Layer

# Techniques 

- Max-Pooling 
  - Downsampling Techniques aimed at achieving some translational invariance 
  - See [Max-Pooling](pooling/readme.md)
