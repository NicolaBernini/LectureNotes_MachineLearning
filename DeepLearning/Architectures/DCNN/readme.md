# Overview 

The Deep CNN Architecture is made of 2 elements 
- Actual CNN 
  - Typically made of alternate convolutional and pooling layers 
- FFNN 
  - Typically a Multilayer Perceptron

## Convolutional Kernels Scanning 

### Description 

A Convolutional Layer can be composed of <img src="http://quicklatex.com/cache3/1b/ql_dc5226e383c8b89c3a3be83c8f90eb1b_l3.png"/> Convolutional Filters 

Each specific Convolutional Kernel acts only on a subset of the Information represented in the previous layer hence its range of action is **local** (no fully connected topology)
- The information stored in the previous layer could be the Raw Image or one layer of the "HyperImage" generated by previous Convolutional Layers 


Typically the Convolutional Kernel Application on the Image overlaps as shown for a 1D Input in Fig1 and Fig2 according to Kernel Size

In the 2D Case (e.g. Image) the Scanning is progressively applied line by line as shown in Fig3

### Results 

In case of a Monochannel `W x H` Image (e.g. greyscale only), the final result of the Application of `K` Convolutional Kernels is a Hyperimage of `W x H x K` dimensions 

In case of a RGB `W x H x 3` Image, the final result of the Application of `K` Convolutional Kernels is a Tensor of `W x H x 3 x K` dimensions 



## Pooling  

The Pooling is a Downsampling Technique 

- Max-Pooling 
  - Downsampling Techniques aimed at achieving some translational invariance 
  - See [Max-Pooling](pooling/readme.md) 



## Modularity 

Different Layers are combined together always respecting the **local topology connectivity** in order to build a lower dimensional and more abstract representation

# Applications 

## Computer Vision 

DCNNs applied to some CV Tasks have reached state-of-the-art performance, sometimes comparable with human level 
- Image Recognition (associating meaning to a whole image)
- Object Detection (locate objects in an image)
- Semantic Segmentation (provide meaning at pixel level)
- Image Captioning (building a description of an image)
