# Overview 

The Deep CNN Architecture is made of 2 elements 
- Actual CNN 
  - Typically made of alternate convolutional and pooling layers 
- FFNN 
  - Typically a Multilayer Perceptron

# Structure 

Typical CNN are composed of alternate Convolutional and Pooling Layers

## Convolutional Kernels Scanning 

A Convolutional Layer can be composed of <img src="http://www.HostMath.com/Show.aspx?Code=N%20%5Cge%201" alt="N>=1"/> Convolutional Filters 

Each specific Convolutional Kernel acts only on a subset of the Information represented in the previous layer hence its range of action is **local** (no fully connected topology)
- The information stored in the previous layer could be the Raw Image or one layer of the "HyperImage" generated by previous Convolutional Layers 


Typically the Convolutional Kernel Application on the Image overlaps as shown for a 1D Input in Fig1 and Fig2 according to Kernel Size

In the 2D Case (e.g. Image) the Scanning is progressively applied line by line as shown in Fig3

# Techniques 

- Max-Pooling 
  - Downsampling Techniques aimed at achieving some translational invariance 
  - See [Max-Pooling](pooling/readme.md)
