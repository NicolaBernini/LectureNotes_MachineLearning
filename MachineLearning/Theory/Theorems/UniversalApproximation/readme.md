# Overview 

## Theorem 

The Universal Approximation Theorem 

It stats that Feed Forward (i.e. stateless) ANN with the following properties 
- at least one hidden layer 
- enough neurons 

can approximate a function which is 
- continuous 
- defined on a compact subset of n-dimensional euclidean space <img src="http://quicklatex.com/cache3/3b/ql_018e77003e1d7a198a87edef0c39743b_l3.png">



## Algo 

The Theorem works by constructing the target function as a weighted sum of the hidden layer's neurons transfer function with appropriate parametrization
