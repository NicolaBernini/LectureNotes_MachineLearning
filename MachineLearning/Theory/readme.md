**What is the different between Parameters and Hyperparameters?**

- Parameters can be automatically learned from Data, during Training 
  - E.g. Neuron Input Weights, ... 
- Hyperparameters can't be automatically learned from Data and a Higher Level Setup 
  - Typically this Parameters Setup is performed by Humans but it could also be addressed by some form of Meta Learning 
  - E.g. Model Complexity, Learning Rate, ...
