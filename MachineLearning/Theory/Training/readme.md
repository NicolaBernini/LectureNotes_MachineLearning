# Overview 

The Element about Training for a Learning Machine 

During Training the Learning Machine Parameters are adjusted according to some metric in order to make it perform better on the Training Data  

# Algo 

Set of Training related Algos  

## Backpropagation 

The Backpropagation is a general Training Algo based on the idea to "backpropagate" the final error, performed with respect to a batch of examples, on the networks params 

- Computing the Error Function Derivative wrt to each Param 

- Modifying each Param so to slightly reduce the error function 

# Training Algo 

- Gradient Descent 
- Stochastic Gradient Descent 
- Minibatch
