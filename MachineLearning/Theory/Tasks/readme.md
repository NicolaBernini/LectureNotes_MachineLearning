## Generic ML High Level Tasks 

List of Generic High Level Tasks 
- Object Recognition 
- Object Detection 

### Object Recognition 

- Input: Data 
- Output: Single Meaning Label 
- Details 
-- The Meaning Label is associated to the whole Input Data 


### Object Detection 

- Input: Data, set of Meaning Labels 
- Output: Subset of the Input Data associated to the Meaning Label 
- Details 
-- It performs a search inside the Input Data for each of the Meaning Labels 
-- Once one is identified, the subset of data associated with it "isolated" from the rest of the data 
-- Example 
--- In Computer Vision, it is equivalent to the problem of defining a bounding box for a specific element (e.g. car, other vehicles, pedestrian, ...)
