# Bayesian Inference 

Bayesian Inference is essentially about solving an Inverse Problem which means inferring the state of something not directly observable using something directly observable which is connected to the former via some causal link 


## Basic 

Let's start from Bayesian Formula 

$$ P(H | O) = \frac{P(O | H) P(H)}{P(O)} $$

with 

- $H$ = Hypothesis 
- $O$ = Observation 
- $P(O|H)$ = Probability of an Observation given an Hypothesis 
- $P(H|O)$ = Probability of an Hypothesis given an Observation 


Here an easy explanation of basic elements 

### Hypothesis 

A term indicating something belonging to a Latent Space which can't be directly observed but which is connected by a cause-effect relationship to the Observable Soace 


### Observations 

A term indicating something belonging to a directly Observable Space
