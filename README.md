Lectures Notes about Machine Learning 

## Description 

The goal of this project is to provide a set of **radically different** lecture notes regarding some Machine Learning related topics. 

The main difference is the way every concept is presented: 

* first a brief description is provided 
* then the concept is presented using the Math formalism 
* finally the same concept is presents by means of an *implementation* realized using a Programming Language, mainly C++ and Python 

The idea is to help students, especially those with a **coding backgroud** to better understand the concepts and to help the reader to think in an **implementative way** 



Hopefully I will soon be able test this method in a lesson
