# LectureNotes_MachineLearning

Lectures Notes about "Machine Learning" learning as an RPG ! 


## Description 

### Learning as RPG 

The goal of this project is to provide a set of **radically different** Lecture Notes regarding Machine Learning related topics, in order **to make learning a funny game**

A sort of **RPG style** will be followed and learning will be achieved following a **Problem Solving Approach** hence by means of good ol'-fashioned **Quests** ! 

So when you want to challenge your knowledge visit the [Quests](Quests) Directory. 

**Free roaming** is also possible and even suggested when stuck in a problem: just visit the other material directories (ot the Web itself !!!) and get the knowledge you need to solve the problems. 



### Material 

Regarding the material in these notes, the main difference with respect to the majority of other notes you can find on the Web about the same topics lies in the way every concept is presented: 

* first a brief description is provided 
* then the concept is presented using the Math formalism 
* finally the same concept is presents by means of an *implementation* realized using a Programming Language, mainly C++ and Python 

The goal is to help students, especially those with a **coding backgroud** to better understand these concepts and to help the reader to think in an **implementative way** 

## Instruction 

A brief set of rules will be provided to play this game and hopefully having fun while learning ! 

### Quests 

Inside the [Quests](Quests) Directory you will continuously find new Quests with different levels complexity and even interconnected among them: as you can easily guess, plot is quite tangled :) 

In each Quest Dir, you will find a `Problem.ipynb` file defining 

* the context (if needed)
* the problem 
* reference to possible Hints 
* reference to solution 
* 

### Free Roaming 

There is no strict order to approach the Quests as well as the Learning Material: you are absolutely free to explore the environment while possibly enjoying it. 

Whether you are stuck in a Quest or you are simply curious, feel free to visit the other Material Directories as well as the Web itlsef to acquire the knowledge you need to solve the Mysteries on your path 



### Prizes 

Surely the best and most desired prize is knowledge however for **real heroes** that would **contribute** to the project providing different and interesting Solutions as well as inspiring and funny suggestions for Quests or suitable Material, there's the **Hall of Fame** in Home Page 



## Hall of Fame
