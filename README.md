# LectureNotes_MachineLearning

Lectures Notes about "Machine Learning" learning as an RPG ! 


## Description 

### Learning as RPG 

The goal of this project is to provide a set of **radically different** Lecture Notes regarding Machine Learning related topics, in order **to make learning a funny game**

A sort of **RPG style** will be followed and learning will be achieved following a **Problem Solving Approach** hence by means of good ol'-fashioned **Quests** ! 

So when you want to challenge your knowledge visit the [Quests](Quests) Directory. 

**Free roaming** is also possible and even suggested when stuck in a problem: just visit the other material directories (ot the Web itself !!!) and get the knowledge you need to solve the problems. 



### Material 

Regarding the material in these notes, the main difference with respect to the majority of other notes you can find on the Web about the same topics lies in the way every concept is presented: 

* first a brief description is provided 
* then the concept is presented using the Math formalism 
* finally the same concept is presents by means of an *implementation* realized using a Programming Language, mainly C++ and Python 

The goal is to help students, especially those with a **coding backgroud** to better understand these concepts and to help the reader to think in an **implementative way** 



Hopefully I will soon be able test this method in a lesson
